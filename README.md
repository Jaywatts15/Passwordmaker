# Passwordmaker
Just a simple script to create semi random passwords that I created while learning the random function.

I am new to Python,, and programming in general is new to me with the exception of some HTML and CSS knowledge from my high school computer science class.
I hope to be able to learn more and post my code on github for practice and help.
